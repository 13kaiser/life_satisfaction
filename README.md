Abstract
This study applies a machine learning (ML) approach to around half a million observations from the
German Socio-Economic Panel to assess the relation between life satisfaction and age. We show that with
our ML-based approach it is possible to isolate the effect of age on life satisfaction across the lifecycle 
without having to explicitly parameterize the complex relation between age and other covariates â€“ this complex 
relation is taken into account by a feedforward neural network. Our results show a clear U-shape relation between 
age and life satisfaction across the lifespan with a minimum at around 55 years of age.
